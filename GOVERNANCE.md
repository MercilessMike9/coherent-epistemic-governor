# Governance

## Normative Authority

The following documents are normative for the Coherent Epistemic Governor (CEG):

- README.md (repository root)

All other documents are informative unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Informative Documents

The following documents provide elaboration, examples, or technical detail but do not override the README:

- spec/ceg-kernel-v1.0-draft.md
- Future examples, formal sketches, or reference implementations

## Change Policy

- Semantic versioning is used.
- Breaking changes require a new major version.
- Changes to normative documents require explicit review.
- Pull requests are accepted only after discussion in issues.

## Scope Discipline

CEG refers exclusively to the non-agentic epistemic kernel defined in README.md.  
Extensions, wrappers, or higher-layer systems must use distinct names.
