## Normative Authority

The file:

`spec/CEG-KERNEL-v1.0.md`

is the **sole normative authority** for the CEG Kernel v1.0.

All other documents in this repository are **non-normative with respect to Kernel v1.0 semantics**. They do not modify, override, extend, or reinterpret `spec/CEG-KERNEL-v1.0.md`.

(Other documents may be normative for their own scopes, e.g., integration protocols, but never for Kernel v1.0.)

---

## Versioning Policy

- `spec/CEG-KERNEL-v1.0.md` is **frozen and canonical**.
- Any future revision must be released as a **new version** in a **separate file** (e.g., `CEG-KERNEL-v1.1.md`, `CEG-KERNEL-v2.0.md`).
- Drafts, if any exist, are **non-normative** and must not be colocated with canonical spec artifacts.
