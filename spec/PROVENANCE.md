# Provenance

This repository contains the canonical normative specification for the
Coherent Epistemic Governor (CEG) Kernel.

## Normative Authority

The file:

    CEG-KERNEL-v1.0.md

is the **sole normative authority** for the CEG Kernel v1.0.

All other documents in this repository — including drafts, threat models,
related work, governance notes, and explanatory materials — are
**non-normative** and provided for context only. They do not modify,
override, or extend the kernel’s binding semantics.

## Authorship and Ownership

Author / Owner: Michael Middleton

The CEG Kernel architecture, specification, and terminology originate
with the author listed above. No transfer of ownership or authorship
is implied by publication.
